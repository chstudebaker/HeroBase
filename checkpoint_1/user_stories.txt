As a Fan (MVP):
As a fan, I want to browse and search for hero profiles, view essential 
information about each hero (such as code name, abilities, and bio), and stay 
updated on the latest hero activities. I also want to connect with other fans 
through basic community features, allowing me to share insights and engage in 
discussions.

As a Writer (MVP):
As a writer, I need access to detailed hero profiles, including code name, 
abilities, and background information, to gather inspiration for crafting hero 
stories. I should be able to contribute my own hero stories to the platform and 
engage in basic collaborative features with other writers.

As an Artist (MVP):
As an artist, I want access to hero descriptions and references to inspire my 
artwork. The MVP should include the ability to showcase my hero-themed art on 
the platform and view artworks contributed by other artists. Basic community 
features should allow for appreciation and feedback on artwork.
