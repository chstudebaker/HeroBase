Got basic website framework up and running. Created entities, Search User servlet 
and Index, Header, and results jsp pages.

Website doesnt work yet, but the code just needs a little fixing.

Had to rework my entire database, again. Added a HeroPowers entity to manage 
relationships.

Added a HeroDao, PowersDao, and HeroPowersDao. Created unit tests for each.
They can run individually just fine, but dont run as a unit yet.

Created log4j functionality and created a hibernate config file.

Got cognito up and running. I can now sign in, create users, and authenticate 
them

Went to the museaum, so did not get much work done. 

However, reworked my database yet again. Figured out that if I put heroId as a
foreign key in Powers, I can reduce my number of tables to two. Genius! Makes
things easier.

Got all my unit tests running individually for both Hero and Powers. Next step is
to get them running at the same time, every time

Another museaum. Seriously, how many of these things are there? (sorry, I just 
to say it)

Created some neat CSS to use with my project. its starting to look like a real
website now!

Started on Add hero feature. Having some trouble creating a dynamic list of 
powers, but Im making it a goal!

Also hoping to allow a user to search on a hero, then use the name as a link to 
a seperate page with a huge dump of information. Like a fandom. Shouldnt be too
hard with EL to work with.

Today, I am planning to make corrections to my project based on the teachers 
feedback. Came back from vaca early, so I am now able to get some serious work 
done. Hoping to have everything fixed by the end of the day.
